# AdventureGame
First game made utilizing the pygames module in python

#### TO RUN: ###########
Run the "main.py" pyfile! Everything is connected to that and all the other pyfiles are imported into it!

This was a summer project I had in 2021.

Things to note:
* I created this as a sophomore! I have only taken introductory data structures and programming in Python at the time, as well as upper division math
  and optimization courses.
* This was more for practice on learning how to self-teach and use modules in Python. Specifically pygames.
* I used a lot of math to accomplish the goals I had for this project.
